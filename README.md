To be able to run the files you'll need to install Sass into your local machine.
If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

    npm install -g sass
    
However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so itâ€™ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed! 
Install on Windows (Chocolatey)

Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)
If you use the Homebrew package manager for Mac OS X or Linux, you can install Dart Sass by running

    brew install sass/sass/sass
    
To run a live site using visual studio code install es-lint use
    
    npm install eslint or npm install -g eslint
